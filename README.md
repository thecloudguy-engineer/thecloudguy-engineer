# About me 
- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @thecloudguy-engineer
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in cloud technologies, back-end tech to build scalable products that improves our lives
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about google cloud platform and fundamentals of building scalable products
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on writing guides on learning GCP, learn about building things
- üì´ How to reach me - Comment here by doing a request :)



## Before Day 0
I have engineering background. I did dabble coding hello world and read about tech frameworks and cloud but never moved beyond reading. My thinking goes into building mode. So this time I am committing myself to be hands-on. 

So what should I learn? I am boxing myself to build a internet based product (so no woodworking folks). For any product, there are several things like front end (interaction with the end user) and backend. My forte is not in the front-end be it color pallette or what clicks. Of course, you can spend time to learn and slowly build expertise. But through my experiences over the last 7 years, I want to go for back end. I worked in sales, business development, managed a product. Through these experiences I feel confindent my curiosity will be satisfied by devouring the back end concepts to build scalable products. 

I want to learn about cloud technologies and building products using cloud and hands on tech by building backends. For this I decided to start with Google cloud platform(GCP). The top 3 cloud platform products are mostly similar. If you understand the products and how reliable, scalable products can be built by understanding suggested best practices, you can quickly get good grasp on cloud tech. Over the last month, I started browsing GCP videos on youtube and did coursera specialization. 

I heavily relies on Priyanka Vergadia playlists and cheatsheets. She is a great teacher!

I went through coursera GCP architect specialization and started giving some practice exams. My plan is to learn the concepts, read up things that I dont know and continue learning. I also found 2 channels on back-end on youtube.

One is full back-end hands on tutorial. In this tutorial, you will build a simple bank application back end using go.
Another one is from Hassan who provides his wisdom and do back end tear downs on products

## Day 1
I started back end master class. I learnt how to design the schema and generate SQL, Postgresql code for the design. 

Simple tutorial -> https://youtu.be/rx6CPDK_5mU

I also went through the first video SSL/TLS playlist by tech school. Understood symmetric encryption and assymetric encryption. One idea was to build a small tool to see how encryption and decryption works in real time or show TLS hand shake in a browser web app. Perhaps a project down the line.

I also started a twitter channel to slowly follow experts in this area and also showcase my progress.

## Day 2
Finished the second tutorial in the backend master claass.
- install docker, pull the postgres image and create a postgres instance
- learnt about alpine version, sometimes you dont need ubuntu linux to run tasks. So you can use alpine to reduce the startup time 
- started reading about designing data intensive applications book. I like the examples espcially twitter where load and performance are defined
- looked into typical interview questions to get a grip on essential concepts (load balancers, caching, protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, protobufs, gRPC, reverse proxy/ proxy, web servers, CI/CD, indexes, databases, SQL, NoSQL, content delivery networks

## Day 3
- went through the 3rd tutorial database migrations
- finished reading about reliability, scalability and maintainability, the first section in the book. Concepts are exaplained very well
- need to check some podcasts to listen while doing some light exercises in the gym

## Day 4
- reading the second section about different data models based on the need - one to many relationships, many to many relationships, many to one relationships
- document based data model, relational data model, graph based data model
- declarative versus imperative benefits
- schema on read versus schema on white (implicit versus explicit schema)

## Day 5
- finished the second section about data models from the book Designing data intensive applications
- started reading the third section from the book about how databases store the data


## Day 6
- finished reading about a simple database storage - log file based, moved on to tree structures
- revised Google cloud architect prep test

## Day 7 
- still reading designing data intensive applications 
- amazed by the explanations about online transactions processing and online analytics processing
- understood both log structured and b tress 

## Day 8
- read about data warehouses, column oriented storage, bitmask and compression
- awesome feeling to know how stuff works
- need to understand about disk writes and reads, how its written onto HDDs, SSDs etc.

## Day 9 
- started section 4 encoding and evolution in designing data intensive applications book
- What's the need for JSON, XML, protobufts, thrift etc
- did the two sum problem in golang

## Day 10
- finished the encoding and evolution section. Now moving on to database replication 
- in a simple database setup - single leader, multiple leaders and leaderless approach for replication
- single leader is done
- started exercism.org golang exercises

## Day 11
- reading multiple leader replication setup
- completed 6 golang exercies 
- learnt about strings package and functions like Trim, TrimSpaces, ReplaceAll etc. 

## Day 12
- reading leaderless replication setup
- completed 3 go programs from exercism golang track

## Day 13
- slow day; did strings related go programs
- quorum rules to select writes and reads in leaderless replication
- super excited to read partitioning! Replication is already complicated in single server database systems. 
Imagine multiple partitions for a database on different servers! uff ü§Ø

## Day 14
- finished replication chapter
- did the go exercise need for speed in exercism and learnt about structs 

## Day 15
- started the partitioning chapter in intensive applications book
- got stuck at booking up for beauty problem @exercism. Instructions to this exercise can be improved and never thought using time function is difficult
- using yourbasic for last 1 week to get crisp idea of golang 

## Day 16

- nothing much, doing my day job and getting ready for weekend for some side projects

## Day 18

## Day 24
- finished grains (number of grains of a chess square) and luhn(valid credit card number check) exercies @exercism.io
- went through Ethereum dev with Go book to run a program that gives you balance for an address

## Day 25
Recently @freeCodeCamp posted Akhil Sharma tutorial 11 projects in Go
